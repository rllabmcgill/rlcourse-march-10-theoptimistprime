    "# TD Models with intermixing Time scales\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we discussed that TD methods can also be used to learn a model of the environment. These models can be used with model based RL architectures. Model-based reinforcement learning allows us to elegantly integrate planning into a real-time learning and decision-making agent.DYNA is one of the preferred architectures for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning can be made much faster using models predicting further into the future - this allows the agent to look farther and get estimates with reduced bias and hence faster convergence. (Side note - I was working to show this very fact but increased variance in the n-Step model was not helping me. I was getting best results with n=1 :-( I'll try demonstrating this again for the next assignment with a few more environments)\n",
    "\n",
    "n-Step models, therefore, can be used for lookahead to find state values - V just like the base model, while requiring significantly fewer steps. One step of lookahead with a 10-step model should exactly be equivalent to 10 steps of lookahead with a 1-step model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, n-Step models are limited in an important way- they insist on a single, fixed time interval n. Besides, it is computationally difficult to precisely learn these n-Step models. Such models are hence impractical and unnecessary. A preferred alternative would be to have temporally abstract prediction model which gives a weighted approximations of future states. [TD Models: Modeling the World at a Mixture of Time Scales](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/papers/sutton-95.ps.gz) introduced the concept of intermixing different time scales for RL predicition problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper suggests that a desired multi-scale model is a mixture of models for all different time scales - \n",
    "$$ P = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} w_{n=1}P^{(n)}$$\n",
    "$$ R = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} w_{n=1}R^{(n)}$$\n",

    "## $$\\beta-Models$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A preferred mixture of n-step models is in which weights fall of exponentially each time step into future. This comes from the fact that number of different future events possible from a point are exponential and hence their effects should have less and less importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_{n} = (1-\\beta) \\beta^{n-1} $$\n",
    "for a fixed parameter between 0 and 1.\n",

    "The paper introduced full-beta models. In these models, beta are allowed to vary from state to state and therefore trajectories have arbitrary weight vectors. \n",

    "## Wall Following domain\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, I illustrate the effectiveness of these full-beta models in Wall Following domain. Wall-following is not a single action or sequence of actions, but a complete closed-loop policy for moving forward while staying close to a wall on one side. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the grid state bellow in the code section. \n",
    "\n",
    "The robot starts at one of the three cells at the bottom and travels up one row per time step. The stocastic policy tries to keep the robot in center column to avoid going into open spacetes.s or colliding with the wall. An episode under this task ends when robot either enters the 'Exit' section of grid, or collides with the 'Wall' or goes out into 'Open Space' and loses sensory contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following experiment I recreate the auther's attempt to learn a temporally abstact predictive model for likely future states. By setting beta of all grid cells at 1 and only giving terminal states beta value of 0, all the learning is about the final terminal states. Predictions for termination to all grid cells are 0 and only values learnt are for the states with beta=0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expiremental probabilities of termination into Wall, Exit and Open Spaces match the expected correct predictions as in the paper as well."
